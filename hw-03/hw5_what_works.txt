- What Works:
I was able to get all functionality to work and pass all of the tests for all packages, most importantly TEST1 and TEST2.
Mainly, I was able to get the new undo and redo functionality working so that all of the tests pass.

- What doesn't work:
I found that everything works based on my testing.

SE 450 HW 8

For this Assignment I attempted to fulfill all of the tasks to my fullest understanding:
- Refactoring UIMenu/UIForm to remove redundant and copied code.
- Refactoring UIMenuBuilder/UIFormBuilder to remove redundant and copied code.
- State pattern in Control (using Enums for the various Menus, Forms)

For the refactoring I combined UIForm and UIMenu into one class so that there will only be one set of methods.
I did the same for UIMenuBuilderand UIFormBuilder in which I combined the classes so that there will be only one set of methods.
I implemented state pattern in Control by using enums for the Start, Exit, and Exited State.
I also used enums for the UIMenuActions.
I also created an auxillary function in UIFactory that eliminates some repeated code in some of the other functions.
